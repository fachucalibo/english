            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Alejandro Elí Basilio Camarillo, from Mexico City. I live in a rustic four-story house. Since I was young, I have always been surrounded by an environment full of creativity and cultural diversity, which has influenced my worldview.</p>
            <p>I love exploring new places and learning about different cultures. My curiosity constantly drives me to seek new experiences, whether through travel, reading, or interacting with people from diverse backgrounds.</p>

            <h2>Influences</h2>
            <p>I draw inspiration from my family and influencers who make a positive difference in the world. My parents have taught me the importance of empathy and hard work, values I deeply appreciate. I also follow several content creators who promote well-being and creativity, and it motivates me to see how they use their platform to inspire others.</p>
            <p>I also love learning about personalities who have left a mark on history, especially those who have fought for their dreams despite adversity.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Sports</h2>
            <p>I enjoy basketball and video games. Playing sports not only keeps me active but also teaches me about teamwork and discipline. I play basketball with my friends on weekends and enjoy local competitions.</p>
            <p>When it comes to video games, I love immersing myself in virtual worlds and competing with friends. I like playing on both consoles and PC, and I enjoy games that require strategy and collaboration.</p>
            <p>I also love frontón, a sport that combines agility and precision. Playing frontón is a way for me to relax and have fun at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Personal Style</h2>
            <p>I don't have a defined fashion style. I prefer comfort, so I often opt for casual clothing that allows me to move freely. However, I also like to experiment with different styles and trends from time to time.</p>
            <p>I believe fashion is a form of expression, and although I don't strictly follow trends, I enjoy mixing and matching pieces that reflect my personality.</p>
